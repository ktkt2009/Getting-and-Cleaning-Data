# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set by a learner.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This project work will be reviewed by peer assessment.

This repo includes

1) a tidy data set
2) the script run_analysis.R
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformation work called CodeBook.md
4)README.md

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
